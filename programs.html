                    academic
                    tracks. HUMSS is for students who want to study journalism, communication arts, liberal arts,

                    other social science-related courses in college. HUMSS courses cover a variety of fields that

                    humanities and
                    social sciences like psychology, sociology, and more. Our students reap the benefits of a HUMSS
                    strand by
                    developing skills like communication, open-mindedness, and a good understanding of the sociological
                    and
                    cultural nuances of the world around them. From there, they can examine and analyze how these shape

                <p><b>Technical-Vocational-Livelihood (TVL)</b> track

                    The SHS program has a Technical-Vocational-Livelihood (TVL) Track, which has four strands:
                    Agri-Fishery
                    Arts, Home Economics (HE), Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and Industrial Arts.
                    These are
                    aligned with Technology and Livelihood Education (TLE) in Grades 7-10. Each TVL strand offers
                    various
                    specializations that may or may not have a National Certificate (NC) equivalent from TESDA. The
                    time
                    allocation per strand specialization is based on TESDA Training Regulations-Based Courses and is
                    only
                    indicative since the standard time allotment of 80 hours per semester per subject will still be
                    applied.
                    Therefore, each strand specialization must be designed to fit into the 80-hour blocks of time.
                    Technology Livelihood Education and Technical-Vocational Livelihood Track Subjects may be taken
                    between
                    Grades 9-12. Schools may offer specializations from the four strands as long as the minimum
                    number
                    of hours
                    for each specialization is met. Curriculum Maps may then be modified according to
                    specializations
                    offered by
                    a school. Below is a list of all the Technology and Livelihood Education and the

                <p><b>General Academic Strand (GAS)</b>The fourth strand in the Academic Track is the General Academic
                    Strand, which has subjects selected from
                    the
                    different strands. This strand is ideal for SHS students who have not yet decided on a particular
                    specialization. This strand, which is also a viable offering in secondary schools with a low student
                    population, allows for electives that may be a combination of related subjects from the other tracks
                    or
                    strands in the SHS curriculum.
                </p>
                <p>The GAS is ideal for students who are undecided about their future career path. It can help you
                    understand
                    your role in the community and to be an upstanding citizen in your country. It can also help you
                    develop
                    a
                    sense of social responsibility and encourage you to contribute to society for its growth and
